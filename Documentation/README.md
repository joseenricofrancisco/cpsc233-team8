- CPSC233 T02-TEAM8
- Project Name: **Battleship**
- Project Descriptionï¼š
  The game that we planned to make is adapted from a famous guessing game, Battleship, that was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s. For our adapted version, the game will have similar mechanics with different rules. The game starts with 5 ships being randomly placed on a 10 by 10 grid. The locations of the ships are unknown for both players which are the user player and the computer. Each player will take turns and guess a coordinate present in the boards boundaries. Players will try to shoot down the ships on the board, the objective of the game is to destroy more ships than the opposing player.
